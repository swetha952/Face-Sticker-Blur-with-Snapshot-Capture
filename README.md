# Face-Sticker-Blur-with-Snapshot-Capture
This project detects faces in real-time using OpenCV, applies a smooth blurred sticker effect with a cute background on each detected face, displays the face count, and allows snapshot saving with 's'. It offers a visually appealing, privacy-friendly video experience from webcam input.
